# Ludum Dare 38 - *theme tbd*

My project for [Ludum Dare 38](https://ldjam.com) - *theme*.

I will be working on this project by myself using Java and the libGDX game development framework. Specifically, I will be using Ashley as the entity-component-system, Box2D for physics and collision detection, and Scene2D for user interface.

The final submission for the event can be found [here](https://ldjam.com/users/exovum/). Additionally, the project will be hosted on [my itch.io page](https://exovum.itch.io).

The starting code I used is available with [this repository](https://github.com/exovum/ludumdare-setup).

During the event, I hope to collect some notes/thoughts and update this readme.
